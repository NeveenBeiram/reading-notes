# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS 
***Responsive web design*** is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

* **Responsive** and **adaptive** web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors.

* **Mobile**, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. While this does occasionally have its place, it normally isn’t a great idea. Mobile websites can be extremely light but they do come with the dependencies of a new code base and browser sniffing, all of which can become an obstacle for both developers and users.

# All About Floats 

In web design, page elements with the CSS float property applied to them are just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around them. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.

```
#firstImg{
    float:right;
}
```

1. **What are floats used for?**
Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
3. **Clearing the Float**
    ```
     #footer{
    clear:both;
    }
    ```
6. **The Great Collapse**
One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn’t always obvious if the parent doesn’t contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

# SMACSS  

***Scalable and Modular
Architecture for CSS***
**SMACSS :** is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.
