Start writing code without understanding the problem is the most common mistake between developers.
To avoid that you have to:

* Read the problem completely twice.
* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
* Optimize the manual steps.
* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
* Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
* Optimize the real code.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

> “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -
Niklas Göke

Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand

    Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

2. Plan

    Don’t dive right into solving without a plan    

3. Divide
    
     break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

    Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer

    Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

4. Stuck?
    * Debug:
    
         Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging     
    * Reassess:
    
         Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?     
    * Research:
        
         Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).  

5. Practice

## 5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

* ***How to Use the 5 Whys***

**The model** follows a very simple seven-step process:

1. Assemble a Team

    Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem
    
    If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. 
    
    Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. Ask the First "Why?"

    Ask your team why the problem is occurring. 

    Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

    For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded. 

5. Know When to Stop

    You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. 


 6. Address the Root Cause(s)

    Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor Your Measures

    Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
