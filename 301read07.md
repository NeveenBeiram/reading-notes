# APIs continued
*Roy Fielding*
* He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

*  The protocol I mentioned, that he helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.

* That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

* Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.


* For anything really. That guy, Roy Fielding, he talks a lot about what those things point to in that research I was talking about. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

* A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...

* Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

* there's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

***REST and HTTP are not same***
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
