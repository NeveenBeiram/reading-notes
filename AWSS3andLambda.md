#  AWS: S3 and Lambda

- Describe “The Cloud”
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.[source](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)

- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [source](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

- What is auto-scaling?
AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes.[source](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)

- What is bandwidth?
 bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

- How do cloud providers compute service costs?
When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

# Term
- Server Instances
A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance

- Containers
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

- Cloud Services
refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.[source](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/digital-workspace/what-is-a-cloud-service.html)

- Cloud Architecture
Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.[source](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture)

- AWS
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.[source](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/Amazon-Web-Services)

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

 EC2/Beanstalk is an Infrastructure as a Service product (IaaS).Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product.
The main difference is that Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features,where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.

### AWS S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.

Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.


### AWS Lambda Basics
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app. You can write Lambda functions in your favorite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.
