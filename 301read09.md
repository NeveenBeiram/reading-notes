## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?

*  how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
2. It does not cause any observable side effects

* Pure functions benefits :
The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.

* Immutability

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

* Refrential transparency
This is when functions consistenly yield the same results for the same input.

* Filter
The filter method filters datat by an atrribute and expects true or false if the element should or shouldn’t be included in the result collection.

* MAP
The map method transforms a coollection by applying a function to all of it’s elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

* Reduce
This is to reduce a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.

* Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability
Refactoring means updating the source code without changing the behaviour of the application. Refactoring helps you keep your code solid, dry, and easy to maintain.
