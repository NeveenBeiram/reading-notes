* ***PUT***  

    is used to update (modifies) the entire resource data .

* ***PATCH*** 

    applies a partial update to the resource,so you can update one value and it won’t affect or change anything else.

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server?

1. ***[Postman](https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/)***

2. ***[mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)***

3. ***[Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)***

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

* ***Swagger*** Test and Document Your APIs , free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.

* ***APIDoc.js*** Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code.

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

SOAP and REST both allow you to create your own API, it possible to transfer data from an application to other applications.

* **SOAP** is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. As SOAP is an official protocol, it comes with strict rules and advanced security features. Higher complexity, it requires more bandwidth and resources which can lead to slower page load times.

* **REST** stands for Representational State Transfer. It’s an architectural style that defines a set of recommendations for designing loosely coupled applications that use the HTTP protocol for data transmission. REST doesn’t prescribe how to implement the principles at a lower level.

## Vocabulary Terms

* **Web Server** A web server is a software that uses HTTP and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

* **Express** is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.

* **Routing** defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints.

* **WRRC** Web Request Response Cycle diagram that describe the flow of data in req/res cycle.

* **Node** (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.

* **Express** is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks

* **npm** is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

* **TDD** “Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

* **CI/CD**  is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
