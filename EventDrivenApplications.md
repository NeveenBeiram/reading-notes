# Event Driven Applications


- Why is access control important?

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. They apply anywhere access is required to perform a business activity and should be adhered to when accessing information in any format, on any device.

- Describe an application that would need access control.

like in facebook group the admin can accept/delete the join request but the normal member can't 
the admin can delete any post the users can delete just their posts.

- What is a role used for?

give permission passed on these roles

- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. Access under RBAC is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the computer system belongs.

Essentially, RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role.

## ***Term***

- Authorization: is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular."to authorize" is to define an access policy.

- Role Based Access Control:  is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.

- Capabilities: the access that a user has in an app like read,write.update.delete




## Preparation Materials

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

Most developers are introduced to concepts of Event-Driven Programming early on in their study of programming yet they might not fully realize it until a bit later. You’ll find that the concept is rather ubiquitous. Check any major framework or software out there and odds are you’ll find evidence of Event-Driven Programming.
