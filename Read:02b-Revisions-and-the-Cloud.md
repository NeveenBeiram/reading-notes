By running the `git remote` command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

```
reading-notes[main]$ git remote
origin

```
***

By using git `remote -v`, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names


```
reading-notes[main ?]$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/NeveenBeiram/reading-notes.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/NeveenBeiram/reading-notes.git (push)
reading-notes[main ?]$
```
