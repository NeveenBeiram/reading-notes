# Layout 

## screen size 

* ***Different visitors to your site*** will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

* ***The size of a user's screen*** affects how big they can open their windows and how much of the page they will see. There are also an increasing number of handheld devices (mobile phones and tablets) that have smaller screens.


## Screen Resolution

**Resolution** refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

It is interesting to ***note*** that
the **higher** the resolution, the
**smaller** the text appears. Many mobile devices have screens that are higher resolution than their desktop counterparts.

## Page Sizes

Because :
**screen sizes** and **display resolutions** *vary* so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.

## Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.
