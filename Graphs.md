# Graphs 
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.

terminology used with Graphs:
- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

- ***Undirected Graphs***
 is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

 - ***Directed Graphs (Digraph)***
  is a graph where every edge is directed.

  ***
  - ***Complete Graphs***
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- ***Connected***
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

- ***Disconnected***
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

### Graph Representation
 graphs represented through:

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
