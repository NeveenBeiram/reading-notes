# SQL
## What is SQL?
Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

* Did you know? 

There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

## Relational databases 
Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

* SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101

```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```

```
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```

* SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)
* SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2) 

```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;

## CREATE DATABASE

`CREATE DATABASE database_name database_name`

##   Delete a database

`DROP DATABASE database_name`

##  Create a table in a database.

```
CREATE TABLE "table_name"
("column_1" "data_type_for_column_1",
"column_2" "data_type_for_column_2",
... )
```

##   Add columns in an existing table. 

```
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype
```
##   Delete columns in an existing table.

```
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name datatype
```

## Delete a table.
`DROP TABLE table_name`

## Create a simple index.

```
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name_1, column_name_2, ...)
```

## Create a unique index. 

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name_1, column_name_2, ...)
```

## Delete a index.

```
DROP INDEX table_name.index_name	
```

## Insert new rows into a table.	

```
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value_1, value_2,....)
```
## Update one or several columns in rows.	

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column_name_1 = new_value_1, column_name_2 = new_value_2
WHERE column_name = some_value
```

## Delete rows in a table.	

```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = some_value
```

## Deletes the data inside the table.

```
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name	
```

## Select data from a table.
`SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name`

## Select all data from a table.	
```
SELECT * FROM table_name	
```

## Select only distinct (different) data from a table.	

`SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s) FROM table_name	`

## Select only certain data from a table.	
```
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column operator value
      AND column operator value
      OR column operator value
      AND (... OR ...)
      ...
```
## The IN operator may be used if you know the exact value you want to return for at least one of the columns.

```
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...)
```

## Select data from a table with sort the rows.
```
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
ORDER BY row_1, row_2 DESC, row_3 ASC, ...
```

##   GROUP BY... 
was added to SQL because aggregate functions (like SUM) return the aggregate of all column values every time they are called, and without the GROUP BY function it was impossible to find the sum for each individual group of column values.
```
SELECT column_1, ..., SUM(group_column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY group_column_name
```

##  HAVING... 
was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used against aggregate functions (like SUM), and without HAVING... it would be impossible to test for result conditions.
```
SELECT column_1, ..., SUM(group_column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY group_column_name
HAVING SUM(group_column_name) condition value
```

## Column name alias
```
SELECT column_name AS column_alias FROM table_name
```
## Table name alias
```
SELECT table_alias.column_name FROM table_name AS table_alias
```

## The INNER JOIN
 returns all rows from both tables where there is a match. If there are rows in first table that do not have matches in second table, those rows will not be listed.

 ```
SELECT column_1_name, column_2_name, ...
FROM first_table_name
INNER JOIN second_table_name
ON first_table_name.keyfield = second_table_name.foreign_keyfield
 ```

 ##  The LEFT JOIN 
 returns all the rows from the first table, even if there are no matches in the second table. If there are rows in first table that do not have matches in second table, those rows also will be listed.

 ```

SELECT column_1_name, column_2_name, ...
FROM first_table_name
LEFT JOIN second_table_name
ON first_table_name.keyfield = second_table_name.foreign_keyfield
 ```

 ##  The RIGHT JOIN
  returns all the rows from the second table, even if there are no matches in the first table. If there had been any rows in second table that did not have matches in first table, those rows also would have been listed.

  ```
  SELECT column_1_name, column_2_name, ...
FROM first_table_name
RIGHT JOIN second_table_name
ON first_table_name.keyfield = second_table_name.foreign_keyfield
  ```

  ##  Select all different values from SQL_Statement_1 and SQL_Statement_2
  ```
SQL_Statement_1
UNION
SQL_Statement_2
  ```
  ## Select all values from SQL_Statement_1 and SQL_Statement_2
  ```
SQL_Statement_1
UNION ALL
SQL_Statement_2
  ```

  ## Select data from table(S) and insert it into another table.

  ```
SELECT column_name(s)
INTO new_table_name
FROM source_table_name
WHERE query
  ```

  ## Select data from table(S) and insert it in another database.
  ```
SELECT column_name(s)
IN external_database_name
FROM source_table_name
WHERE query
  ```

  ##  Create a virtual table based on the result-set of a SELECT statement.
  ```
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
  ```
