 ## What Is Node and When Should I Use It? 
 * What Is Node.js? 

 `Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.`

`Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.`

Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

***The V8 engine*** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

* Node Binaries vs Version Manager
Many websites will recommend that you head to the official Node download page and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.

* “Hello, World!” the Node.js Way
You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing` node -v`. If all has gone well, you should see something like` v12.14.1` displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

* Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager
As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type `npm -v`.

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let’s take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package.

* Installing a Package Globally 
Open your terminal and type the following:

`npm install -g jshint`
This will install the jshint package globally on your system. We can use it to lint the` index.js `file from the previous example:

`jshint index.js`
You should now see a number of ES6-related errors. If you want to fix them up, add `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` to the top of the `index.js` file, re-run the command and linting should pass.

* Installing a Package Locally 
We can also install packages locally to a project, as opposed to globally, on our system. Create a `test` folder and open a terminal in that directory. Next type this:

`npm init -y`
This will create and auto-populate a `package.json` file in the same folder. Next, use npm to install the lodash package and save it as a project dependency:

`npm install lodash --save`

Create a file named `test.js` and add the following:

```
const _ = require('lodash');

const arr = [0, 1, false, 2, '', 3];
console.log(_.compact(arr));
```

Finally, run the script using `node test.js`. You should see `[ 1, 2, 3 ] `output to the terminal.

* Working with the package.json File
If you look at the contents of the `test` directory, you’ll notice a folder entitled `node_modules`. This is where npm has saved lodash and any libraries that lodash depends on. The `node_modules` folder shouldn’t be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running `npm install` from within the project’s root.

If you open the` package.json` file, you’ll see lodash listed under the `dependencies `field. By specifying your project’s dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.

* What Is Node.js Used For?
Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

And if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). This isn’t because you need a Node back end to run these frameworks. You don’t. Rather, it’s because these frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.
