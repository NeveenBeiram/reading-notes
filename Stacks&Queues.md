# Stacks & Queues

## Stack

* **What is a Stack**

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* ***Common terminology for a stack is:***
1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped.
3. Top - This is the top of the stack.
4. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.
5. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


### LIFO (Last In First Out )
This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Queues 

* ***Common terminology for a queue is:***

1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue.
3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. 
6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### FIFO (First In First Out)
This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.
