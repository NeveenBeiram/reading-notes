# Chapter 18 - Process & Design

## Prpcess you can use when you are creating website:

 It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure the pages feature the information those visitors need.

 ***it is important to look at:***
1. How to understand the audience your site  may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it.
3. How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for

5. Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals

6. Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites

### who is the site for:
 * 	What is the age range of your ausience ?


* Will your site appeal to more women or man or mix ?

* 	Which country do you visitor live in ?

### Target audience : companies 
 
 * what is the size of the company or relevant department ?
* What is the position of people in the company who visit your site ?
* Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else? 
* How large is the budget they control ?

Invent some fictional visitor from your typical target audience. They will become your friends . (they can influence design decision from color palettes to level of detail in description )

### Why people visit your website ? 

After you know who your visitors are, you nees to consider why they are coming . 
Some people will across your website by chance but most will visit for specific reason 

- Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users.

To help determine why people
are coming to your website,
there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:
1. The first attempts to discover
the underlying motivations for
why visitors come to the site.

2. The second examines the
specific goals of the visitors.
These are the triggers making
them come to the site now.

### What your visitors are trying to achieve 
It is ***impossible*** to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivation .

### What information your visitors need 
After you are knowing who is coming to visit your site and why they are coming , now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals 
You can offer additional information that you think they might find helpful .

### How often people will visit your site ?

There is some site must updating more frequently than others . some information such as news may be constantly changing , while other content remains relatively static.

### Site maps 

Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.

To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.

The pages (or groups of pages)
will inform how users navigate
through the site.

### WireFrames
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes.
This involves **sketching** or shading areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary
navigation, headings and main
bodies of text, user logins etc).

By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.

You should not include the color scheme, font choices,
backgrounds or images for
the website in the wireframe.
It should focus on what
information needs to be on
each page and create a visual
hierarchy to indicate the most
important parts of each page.

The wireframes make design
easier **because** *you know what
information needs to appear on
which page before considering
how the the page should look.*

It can be very *helpful* to show the wireframes of a site to a client before showing them a design.
It **enables** the client to ensure
the site has all the functions and
information it needs to offer.

### Getting your message across using design
* The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

*  content 

Web pages often have a lot of
information to communicate.
For example, the pages of
online newspapers will have
information that does not appear
on every page of the print equivalent

* Prioritizing

If everything on a page appeared
in the same style, it would be
much harder to understand. (Key
messages would not stand out.)

*  Organizing

Grouping together related
content into blocks or chunks
makes the page look simpler
(and easier to understand).

### Visual hierarchy
Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

1. Size
3. color
5.  style
8. images

So *Visual hierarchy* refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

### grouping and Similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

We naturally observe similarities in design, and things that are similar are
perceived to be more related than things that are dissimilar.

Repetition of similar color, size, or ientation, texture, font, or shape, suggests that matching elements have similar importance or meaning.

### Designing Navigation

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles...

# Chapter 1- Structure

In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.

### How Pages Use Structure

Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved.
Structure helps readers understand the stories in the
newspaper.

### Structuring Word Documents

The use of headings and
subheadings in any document
often reflects a hierarchy of
information. For example, a
document might start with
a large heading, followed by
an introduction or the most
important information.

This might be expanded upon
under subheadings lower down
on the page. When using a word
processor to create a document,
we separate out the text to give it structure.

Each topic might
have a new paragraph, and each
section can have a heading to
describe what it covers.

### HTM L Describes the Structure of Pages

```
<html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
Html uses elements to describe the structure of pages 
Photo of html code describe structure elements 

Tags act like containers 
They tell you about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags 








***
**ttributes tell us more about elements**
It is provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and value separated by an equals sign 
`<p lang=”en-us”>paragraph in English </p>`

The attribute name indicates
what kind of extra information
you are supplying about the
element's content. It should be
written in lowercase.

The value is the information
or setting for the attribute. It
should be placed in double
quotes. Different attributes can
have different values.

Here an attribute called lang is
used to indicate the language
used in this element. The value
of this attribute on this page
specifies it is in US English.

### Body, Head & Title
`<body>`

You met the` <body> `element
in the first example we created.Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.

`<head>`

Before the `<body>` element you
will often see a `<head>` element.
This contains information
about the page (rather than
information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page). You will usually find a `<title>` element inside the `<head>` element.

`<title>`

The contents of the` <title>`
element are either shown in the
top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of
the page you want to visit, or
on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

Anything written between the
`<title>` tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window
Anything written between
the `<body>` tags will appear
in the main browser window
You may know that HTML
stands for HyperText Markup
Language. The HyperText part
refers to the fact that HTML
allows you to create links that
allow visitors to move from one
page to another quickly and
easily. A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. If you think of a web page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.


### Looking at How Other sites are Built

When the web was first taking
off, one of the most common
ways to learn about HTML and
discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.




 # Chapter 17- html5 layout

HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

### Traditional HTML Layouts

For a long time, web page authors used `<div>` elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used **class** or **id** attributes to indicate the role of the `<div>` element in the structure of the page.

## New html5 layout elements


HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

## Headers & Footers
`<header> <footer>`

The `<header>` and `<footer>`
elements can be used for:

* The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
*  A header or footer for an
individual `<article>` or `<section>` within the page.

## Navigation

`<nav>`

The `<nav>` element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.


## Articles
`<article>`

The `<article>` element acts as
a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

The `<aside>` element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an `<article>`
element or not.
When the `<aside>` element
is used inside an `<article>`
element, it should contain
information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.
When the `<aside>` element is
used outside of an `<article>`
element, it acts as a container
for content that is related to
the entire page.

## Sections
`<section>`

The `<section>` element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.


## Heading Groups
`<hgroup>`

The purpose of the1` <hgroup>`
element is to group together a
set of one or more `<h1>`through `<h6>` elements so that they are treated as one single heading.


## Figures
`<figure> <figcaption>`


You already met the `<figure>`
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

## Sectioning Elements

`<div>`

It may seem strange to follow
these new elements by revisiting
the `<div>` element again. (After all, the new elements are often going to be used in its place.)
the `<div>` element will remain an important way to
group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

## Linking Around Block-Level Elements

HTML5 allows web page authors
to place an `<a>` element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
This is not a new element in
HTML5, but it was not seen as a
correct usage of the `<a>` element in earlier versions of HTML.

## Helping Older Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.
{Header,section,footer,aside,nav,article,figure;display: block;}

***

 # Chapter 8- Extra markup

 ## The Evolution of HTML
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed
to be an improvement on the
last (with new elements and
attributes added and older code
removed).

There have also been several
versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest browsers installed on their computers, which means
that not everyone will be able to view all of the latest features and markup.

## DOCTYPEs

Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.


## Comments in HTML

`<!--    -->`

If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:

`<!-- comment goes here -->`

It is a good idea to add
comments to your code because,
no matter how familiar you
are with the page at the time
of writing it, when you come
back to it later (or if someone
else needs to look at the code),comments will make it much
easier to understand.

Although comments are not
visible to users in the main
browser window, they can be
viewed by anyone who looks at
the source code behind the page.

On a long page you will often
see comments used to indicate
where sections of the page start or end, and to pass on notes to help anyone who is looking at the code understand it.

Comments can also be used
around blocks of code to stop
that code from being displayed
in the browser. In the example on the left, the email link has been commented out.




## ID Attribute
Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).

It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).


## Class attribute :
Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document, you will want a
way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.


## Block Elements

Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.
Examples of block elements are
`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`.

## Inline Elements
Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
`<a>`, `<b>`, `<em>`, and `<img>`.


## Grouping Text & Elements In a Block
`<div>` 

block-elements.html HTML The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

`<span>`

The `<span>` element acts like
an inline equivalent of the `<div>` element
It is used to either:

1. Contain a section of text
where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
4. Contain a number of inline
Elements The most common reason why people use `<span> `elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.
You will usually see that a class or id attribute is used with `<span>` elements:
* To explain the purpose of this `<span>` element
* So that CSS styles can be
applied to elements that
have specific values for these
attributes.


## IFrames
`<iframe>`

An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

One common use of iframes
(that you may have seen on
various websites) is to embed
a Google Map into a page. The
content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).
There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it:

**src**

The src attribute specifies the
URL of the page to show in the
frame.

**height**

The height attribute specifies
the height of the iframe in pixels.

**width**

The width attribute specifies
the width of the iframe in pixels.

**scrolling**

The scrolling attribute will
not be supported in HTML5.

**seamless**

 In HTML5, a new attribute called ***seamless*** can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. The seamless attribute (like some other new HTML5 attributes) does not need a value, but you will often
see authors give it a value of
seamless. Older browsers
do not support the seamless
attribute.

## Information About Your Pages

`<meta>`

The `<meta>` element lives
inside the `<head>` element and
contains information about that
web page.

It is not visible to users but
fulfills a number of purposes
such as telling search engines
about your page, who created
it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.)

The `<meta>` element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.
