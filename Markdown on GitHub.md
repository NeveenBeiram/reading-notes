**Basic writing and formatting syntax**
***

Headings : 

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

***
# The largest heading (1 # )

## The second largest heading (##)
### the third heading (###)
#### the fourth heading (4#)
##### the fifth (5#)
###### The smallest heading (6 #)

***
**This is bold text** ((Bold) put 2 * before and after the text )

*This text is italicized* ((Italic) put * before and after the text)

~~This was mistaken text~~ ((Strikethrough) put ~~ before and after the text)

**This text is _extremely_ important** (Bold and nested italic (put _ before and after the word )in the bold text between ** here  ** )

Quoting text : (You can quote text with a > ) 
In the words of Abraham Lincoln: 
> pardom my french 
***
## Quoting code :

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

***
Links :

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
